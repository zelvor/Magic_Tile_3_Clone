Game Structure consists of 3 main parts:
1. Game Manager: Manages the game's states and overall flow.
2. Game Spawner: Spawns tiles on four vertical rows using Object Pooling for optimization.
3. UI Manager: Manages all UI components.

Additionally, there may be auxiliary components such as Prestart or components that contain horizontal/vertical bars.
