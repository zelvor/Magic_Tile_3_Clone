# Magic_Tile_3_Clone

Game Structure consists of 3 main parts:
1. Game Manager: Manages the game's states and overall flow.
2. Game Spawner: Spawns tiles on four vertical rows using Object Pooling for optimization.
3. UI Manager: Manages all UI components.

Additionally, there may be auxiliary components such as Prestart or components that contain horizontal/vertical bars.


# Suggested improvement: You could consider adding an item that slows down the tempo (both the song's speed and the falling speed of the notes).

This item could be a power-up or booster that players can collect or activate during gameplay. When activated, it would temporarily slow down the tempo of the song and the falling speed of the notes, providing players with a temporary advantage and making it easier for them to complete the tiles.
